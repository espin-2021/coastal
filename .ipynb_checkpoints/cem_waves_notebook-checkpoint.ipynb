Storm events often bring longer, higher energy waves that can drastically alter shorelines in a short amount of time. Waves that crash into the coast are also often equal in height and period, and are typically modeled as groups of waves through spectral analysis. In this exercise, we will examine how variations in wave climate will alter our shoreline morphology through time.\n",
